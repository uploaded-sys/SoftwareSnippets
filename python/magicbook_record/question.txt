Backstory: Imagine you’re a librarian at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
You’ve been tasked with organizing all the magical books in the library.
Each book has a title, an author, a publication year, and a magical level (which is a number indicating how magical the book is).

To make your job easier, you decide to create a Python program using classes 
to represent each book and perform operations on them.

Problem: Design a Book class in Python with the following specifications:

The Book class should have the following attributes: title, author, publication_year,
and magical_level. The magical_level should be a number between 1 and 10.
The Book class should have a method called display_info() that prints out all #
the information about the book in a readable format.
The Book class should have a method called is_rare()
that returns True if the book’s magical_level is 8 or above, and False
