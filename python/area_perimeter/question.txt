1. The 'Rectangle' class should have an initializer method (__init__) that accepts two parameters: 'length' and 'width'.
2. The class should have a method named 'area' that returns the area of the rectangle.
3. The class should have another method named 'perimeter' that returns the perimeter of the rectangle.

Your task is to implement this 'Rectangle' class and create an instance of 
this class with length 5 and width 4. Then, call the 'area' and 'perimeter' methods 
on this instance and print the results
